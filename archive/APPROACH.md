# Ideas on how to approach the task 

1. We have a predictor system (i suspect we can get away with a SVM for that)
  a. 1st train on simulated data
  b. when real data is avaliable switch to that
  
2. With a trained predictor train a generator to fool the predictor 

## Predictor System
### Simulated Data
> Find some sort of approximation of how people work under the stroop effect

### Real Data 
Data collected with Bender UI - https://github.com/idealab-org/bender-ui

## Generator System
